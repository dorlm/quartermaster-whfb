## Warhammer Fantasy Battle Quartermaster Templates

This project is to expand the existing Quartermaster templates from qmtemplates.com to include item descriptions. The goal of the project is to have all Basic Rulebook and Army Book item descriptions entered into the Quartermaster Templates to expand their usefulness in the system.

Volunteers should coordinate what they're adding and/or editing. It will take a long time for a few people to do it, but if a lot of people jump on board and do a few items each, it will go very quickly.

Note that Quartermaster templates are NOT a substitute for buying the Army Book. Many jurisdictions make allowances for having digital backups of owned works, and that's essentially what this is. Do not download templates for Army Books you don't own.

## How to contribute

There are a few ways to contribute:

  1. Start by looking at the [project roadmap](https://github.com/tom-keenoy/quartermaster-whfb/wiki/Project-Roadmap) to see what parts have been assigned already. No sense in doing something someone else has already started working on.
  2. Easiest: send typed up paragraphs of item descriptions to qmtemplateproject (at) gmail (dot) com.
  3. Slightly less easy: open a template in your favorite text editor and add the key and value tags as shown in the demo. Send the file to the same email address listed above.
  4. Nerdly: fork the project, make your edits, request a pull back to the main project. If you have any idea what I just said, then I'd love some help merging edits submitted in the other ways listed above. Holler and we'll talk.
  5. Review stuff that's already been posted, looking for errors.

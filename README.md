Warhammer Fantasy Battle Quartermaster Templates

This project is to expand the existing Quartermaster templates from qmtemplates.com to include item descriptions. The goal of the project is to have all Basic Rulebook and Army Book item descriptions entered into the Quartermaster Templates to expand their usefulness in the system.

Volunteers should coordinate what they're adding and/or editing. It will take a long time for a few people to do it, but if a lot of people jump on board and do a few items each, it will go very quickly.

Note that Quartermaster templates are NOT a substitute for buying the Army Book. Many jurisdictions make allowances for having digital backups of owned works, and that's essentially what this is. Do not download templates for Army Books you don't own.
